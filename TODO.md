# TODO: Fix Inngest Failed Error

## Completed Steps
- [x] Fixed MongoDB connection string interpolation in config/db.js (changed single quotes to backticks for template literal)
- [x] Added try-catch error handling and logging to syncUserCreation function in config/inngest.js
- [x] Added try-catch error handling and logging to syncUserUpdate function in config/inngest.js
- [x] Added try-catch error handling and logging to syncUserDeletion function in config/inngest.js

## Pending Steps
- [x] Verify environment variables are set correctly (MONGODB_URI, and any Inngest keys if required) - FOUND ISSUE: MONGODB_URI must start with "mongodb://" or "mongodb+srv://"
- [x] Run the development server (`npm run dev`) and check console logs for any errors - Server started successfully on port 3002 without errors
- [ ] Update MONGODB_URI in .env to include the full connection string (e.g., mongodb://localhost:27017 or mongodb+srv://cluster.mongodb.net)
- [ ] Test Inngest functions by triggering user creation/update/deletion events (e.g., via Clerk dashboard or API)
- [ ] Check Inngest dashboard for function execution status and detailed error messages
- [ ] If errors persist, review logs and environment variables for missing configurations

## Notes
- Ensure .env file contains valid MONGODB_URI
- Inngest may require INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY or other env vars depending on setup
- Console logs now include success/error messages for debugging
